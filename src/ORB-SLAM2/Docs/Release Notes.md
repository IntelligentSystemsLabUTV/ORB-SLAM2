# ORB-SLAM2 - Release notes

**DISCLAIMER: This document refers to initial changes prior to 2020.**

## 1. Changes

Adding the following API calls to the wrapper:

```c++
void * initSLAM(char *strVocFile, char *strSettingsFile, int sensor, int saveMap);

void closeSLAM(void *System);

float * runSLAM(void *System, void *im, void *depth, int width, int height, double timestamp);

int statusSLAM(void *System);

int mapChangedSLAM(void *System);
```

## 2. initSLAM

This function initialize the ORB-SLAM2 algorithm. It needs a vocabulary file `strVocFile` (in .fbow format), a settings file `strSettingsFile` for both the hardware and the algorithm parameters, an integer that describes the `sensor` mode (0 for Monocular, 1 for Stereo, 2 for RGBD) and a `saveMap` integer to tell the algorithm to save the map after closing the SLAM or not (it can be 0 or 1). It returns a class of type `System`.

## 3. closeSLAM

This function closes the ORB-SLAM2, deallocating all the memory, calling all the destructors and saving map if this option has been specified in the `initSLAM` API call. In order to call this function a pointer to a class of type `System` must be given as input.

## 4. runSLAM

This function tells the ORB-SLAM2 system to run. It needs a pointer to a class of type `System`, a pointer to both an infrared and depth images, the frames width and height and a timestamp of the frames. The function returns an array of floats with [x, y, z] position and a quaternion [qw, qx, qy, qz] for the orientation (the values are concatenated so it is a 7 elements array).

## 5. statusSLAM

This function checks the status of the tracker in ORB-SLAM2 algorithm. It accepts as an input a class of type `System`. It returns an int with a value for the tracker state: -1 (system not ready), 0 (no images yet), 1 (not initialized), 2 (ok), 3 (track lost).

## 6. mapChangedSLAM

This function checks the status of the loop closure ORB-SLAM2 algorithm. It accepts as an input a class of type `System`. It returns an int with 0 if no loop closure has been made from the last call to this function, 1 otherwise.
