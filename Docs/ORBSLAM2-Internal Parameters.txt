mnCovisibilityConsistencyTh = 3 (LoopClosing.cc - Line 42)
Covisibility Consistency Threshold.
For each loop candidate check consistency with previous loop candidates.
Each candidate expands a covisibility group (keyframes connected to the loop 
candidate in the covisibility graph). A group is consistent with a previous
group if they share at least a keyframe. We must detect a consistent loop in
several consecutive keyframes to accept it (the consecutive keyframes are given
by the mnCovisibilityConsistencyTh).

(LoopClosing.cc - Line 112)
If the map contains less than x (10) keyframes or less than x (10) keyframes
have passed from last loop detection, return false as no loop detected.

An ORB matcher is used with a nn ratio of 0.75.

If there are more than 20 matches between a the keyframe and the candidate,

20 minimal inliers and 300 as max iterations.

(LoopClosing.cc - Line 383)
A loop is defined as a loop when more than 40 matches have been found.

An ORB matcher is used with a nn ratio of 0.7 for tracking the reference
key frame.

If the number of matches is less than 15, returns false.

(Tracking.cc - Line 802)
If the number of matches, discarding outliers, is more or equal to 10,
returns true.

(Tracking.cc - Line 866)
All the points closer than ThDepth are inserted unless these are less than 100,

(Tracking.cc - Line 1288)
If less than 80 keyframes that observe a map point are included 
in the local map, then it is filled up to 80 using keyframes
